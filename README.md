# Vue 2 Prerendering Project

This is the project based on the [Vue 2 SEO Prerendering Tutorial](https://coursetro.com/posts/code/140/Vue-Prerender-Plugin-Tutorial---Vue-2-SEO-without-Server-Side-Rendering) from Coursetro.com

Simply clone the repo, run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.

Then, hop into `/dist` and run a `http-server` (install it if you don't have it installed yet) and open up `http://localhost:8080`.

View the inspector and you will find all of the HTML has rendered.

Enjoy!
